# Malaria-Detection using computer vision

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help tackle some of the world’s most challenging world problems and when 
coupled with popular tools and technologies  for development and betterment of our society ,what the point of techology when it can't help the needy and save lives. Deep learning helps us to  build robust, scalable and effective solutions which can be adopted by everyone even in remote corners of the world and detection of Malaria is one of the problem which Deep learning has help to to tackle.

## Malaria

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable.According to WHO their are 212 Million malaria cases and 435000 deaths.Early diagnostics and treatment of malaria can prevents deaths.Malaria is prevalent across the world especially in tropical regions
The severity of malaria varies based on the species of plasmodium.
Symptoms are chills, fever and sweating, usually occurring a few weeks after being bitten.

If efficent detection of malaria is made then deaths can be avoided which will ave families and communities from downward spiral of poverty.
Most of the 435000 who died of Malaria were children, mainly in Africa, which is hyperendemic for malaria.when severe malaria does occur, malnourished children have a higher morbidity and mortality.when severe malaria does occur, malnourished children have a higher morbidity and mortality.when severe malaria does occur, malnourished children have a higher morbidity and mortality.

Malaria is one of the world’s deadliest diseases, and remains one of the top child killers on the planet. Malaria also keeps children from going to school, families from investing in their future, and communities from prospering, taking a huge toll on lives, livelihoods and countries’ progress.

## Microscopic Diagnosis

Malaria parasites can be identified by examining under the microscope a drop of the patient’s blood, spread out as a “blood smear” on a microscope slide. Prior to examination, the specimen is stained to give the parasites a distinctive appearance. This technique remains the gold standard for laboratory confirmation of malaria. However, it depends on the quality of the reagents, of the microscope, and on the experience of the laboratorian.WHO recommends that all cases of suspected malaria be confirmed using parasite-based diagnostic testing (either microscopy or rapid diagnostic test) before administering treatment. Results of parasitological confirmation can be available in 30 minutes or less.

The research  paper on which the data and analysis is constructed , ‘ Pre-trained convolutional neural networks as feature extractors toward improved Malaria parasite detection in thin blood smear images’ by S Rajaraman et. al. introduces to some of these methods. These include thick and thin blood smear examinations, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) the latter two tests are surrogate methods  used an  alternative particularly where good quality microscopy services cannot be readily provided.
